"""Types of Python Data Types:
We have basically 4 types of datatypes.
1. Numeric Type  2. Dictionary  3. Sequence Type  4. Set 5. Boolean
There are sub datatypes:

Numeric:- 1. Integers  2. Floats  3. Complex
Sequence:- 1. List 2. Tuple 3. Strings

When we see on internet we got :- Integer, Float, Complex, Dictionary,List,Tuples,Boolean, Strings & Set

integer:- 1,2,3
float:- 1.2,2.3
complex = 5i+6j
Dictionary : {"a":123,"b":"VAibhav} Key: Value 
List= [1,2,3,4,5]
Tuples = (1,2,3,4)
Strings = "Vaibhav", 'Thapli',"123"
Set:  a = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
Boolean : True, False
