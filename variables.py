"""Python variables are simply containers for storing data values. Unlike other languages, such as Java.
Python has no command for declaring a variable, so we create one the moment we first assign a value to it.
"""
# Ex:- a= 12 , c = 20, d ="Vaibhav"
# here a,c & d are variable that stores the values.

x=5
y=23
z = x+y
name = "Vaibhav"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
print(name)
print(x,y,z,name)

""" Rules to name a Varaible:
1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore(_).
2. Variable name can only contain letters,numbers and underscores (_). Special characters and spaces are allowed.
3. Variable name are case-sesitive (myName and myname are treated as different variables).
4. Avoid using Python keywords and built-in function name as variable names(eg: print,if,for,while etc)
5. Variable names should be descriptive and indicate the purpose of the variable (eg: name, school, class, etc.)
6. It's recommended to use lowercase letters for variables names, and for names with multiple words,use underscores to seprate them(snake_case)
